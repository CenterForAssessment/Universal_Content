Report Meta Data
================

#  Purpose

This subdirectory contains meta-data necessary for the creation of the Learning Loss Analyisis reports.
Specificaly, the report configuration and RMD child file information that are considered "universal" to
these reports are contained here for access by each state/organization for which a report will be
generated.

#  Included files

* The `Report_Configs.R` file contains `R` code that stores general report information in an appropriately
formated (named) `list` object.  This object is given the name `report.config` and will be available for
manipulation upon using `source(...)` to load it into the working `R` environment.
  - Information such as the report title/subtitle, author names/affiliations and parameters (data) that
  are required to created report content (tables/plots/conditional text) are stored in this file.
  - This universal list can be combined with another list with customized meta-data (named `custom.config`
  in order to add client specific meta-data into the `report.config` list (state name, people to acknowledge
  etc.), or to change/update any of the universal meta-data that is stored in the `report.config` list.
* The `Report_Content.R` source code provides child RMD file information also stored as a `list` object.
This meta-data includes the names of child files that all reports will likely contain (at a minimum). This
object is given the name `rmd.files` and will be available for manipulation upon using `source(...)` to
load it into the working `R` environment.
  - File name and order information is stored as the file name only (not a file path).  The file paths are
  constructed based on the universal and custom child document paths provided in the `report.config` object
  (`report.config$params$unvrsl.rmd.path` and `report.config$params$custom.rmd.path`).  
  - Customized .Rmd documents based on "universal" child documents should be named identically if they
  are meant to replace the universal version entirely.  If they are meant to supplement or are entirely
  novel, they should be named uniquely and their position in the report noted in the final `rmd.files$file.order`
  element of the list.
  - Other information about the file order/content is also included here.  For example, if file order
  should be different for the `pagedown` output (so as to optimize page breaks or table placement), this
  can be specified here.  Or if the documents include citations that should be included in a "References"
  section.
  - Supplemental appendices are included in a separate "branch" of the list than the main report.

These two lists that are subsequently used by functions in the `Literasee` package to create a "NCIEA"
themed report and website.  See the "Learning_Loss_Analysis/Documentation" subdirectory for example
scripts of how to `source(...)` these two documents to create the master lists for the "Demonstration_COVID"
toy data analysis and render the report/website.
