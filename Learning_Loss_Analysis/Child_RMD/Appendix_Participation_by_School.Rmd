## Participation by School Level

<!--  
  If we want to make this universal, the stats in the text below will need to be
  identified in a "Report_Analyses" object and extracted in a generic way.
  Or add a custom .Rmd for each state...

Figures `r figNum(1)` and `r figNum(2)` plot the cumulative number of non-participating
students at the school level. On the x-axis, schools are ordered by number of
non-participating students, from greatest to least. The figures show that most of
the non-participation can be accounted for by a minority of the schools. In ELA,
447 out of 1,799 schools had at least one student who did not test. In Math 556
out of 1,799 schools had at least one student who did not test.
