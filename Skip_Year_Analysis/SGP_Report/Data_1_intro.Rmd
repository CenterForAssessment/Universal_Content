#  Data

`r params$state.name` has extensive historical state summative assessment data from the [`r params$test.name[1]` (`r params$test.abv[1]`)](`r noquote(params$test.url[1])`) `r if(length(params$test.name) > 1) paste0("and [", params$test.name[2], " (", params$test.abv[2], ")](", params$test.url[2], ")")` in `r params$GL_text_long` for grades `r min(as.numeric(params$seq.grades))-1` to `r max(as.numeric(params$seq.grades))` `r if(!is.null(params$test.trans.year)) paste0("(transitioning from ", params$test.trans.name, " assessments in 2019)")` to examine how skip-year growth and one-year growth are related.`r ifelse(!is.null(params$additional.data.description), params$additional.data.description, "")` To do so we calculated skip-year growth for 2019 (using `r SGP:::yearIncrement("2019", 1, (params$sgp.max.order+2))` to 2017 `r if(!is.null(params$test.trans.year)) paste(params$test.trans.name, "assessments")` as priors). These skip-year growth quantities were then compared to one-year growth at the individual level and, when aggregated by school, at the school level.
