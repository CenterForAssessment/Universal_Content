In general, there are fewer students with a skip-year SGP (prior test score from two years ago) than a one-year SGP. For all grades and content areas for which *both* skip-year and one-year SGPs can exist, `r both.pct`% of students have both a one-year and skip-year SGP, while `r sequential.pct`% of students have a one-year SGP but no skip-year SGP. Only `r skip.pct`% of students have a skip-year SGP but not a one-year SGP. And `r neither.pct`% of students have neither.

Overall, these counts indicate there is no evidence of systematic under-representation that would compromise the representativeness of the student population used for skip-year growth calculations. For 2021, additional columns should be added to Table `r tblNum()` indicating counts and percentages of students with skip-year growth. Any values differing dramatically from the 2019 skip-year counts would undermine claims about the representativeness of the 2021 growth calculations. In the next section we investigate the results more thoroughly to determine whether skip-year growth can be used in lieu of one-year growth.
