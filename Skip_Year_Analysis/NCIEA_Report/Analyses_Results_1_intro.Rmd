#  Analyses and Results

Analyses were conducted for grades `r min(as.numeric(params$seq.grades))` to `r max(as.numeric(params$seq.grades))` for one-year SGPs and in grades `r min(as.numeric(params$skip.grades))` to `r max(as.numeric(params$skip.grades))` for skip-year SGPs in `r params$GL_text` for the 2019 `r paste0(params$test.abv, collapse="/")` administration`r if(!is.null(params$skip.grades.list)){" (as available for each content area)"}`. All analyses were conducted using the [`R` Software Environment](http://www.r-project.org/) [@Rsoftware] in conjunction with the [`SGP` package](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP) [@sgp2020]. `r if(!is.null(params$skip.code.url)) {paste0("Source code associated with one-year analyses is available at [this link](", noquote(params$seq.code.url), ") and source code associated with skip-year analyses is available at [this link](", noquote(params$skip.code.url), ").")}`

Both sets of analyses are considered "standard" and resulted in no warnings or errors during calculation. In general, both one-year and skip-year SGP analyses yielded excellent data fit. This is consistent with the excellent fit of analyses run previously in `r params$state.name`. Goodness of fit plots for relevant 2019 one-year and skip-year analyses are provided in Appendix A. Because growth percentiles are uniformly distributed, mean, median and standard deviation for one-year and skip-year SGPs are virtually identical. In the following we present results comparing one-year and skip-year SGPs at the individual level followed by results at the school level.
