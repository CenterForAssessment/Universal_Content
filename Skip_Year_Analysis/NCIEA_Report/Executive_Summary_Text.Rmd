The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching effects on all facets of our lives. The impact on education included school closures in Spring 2020 and a 2020-2021 academic school year mixing remote and in-person instruction that is looking quite different from pre-pandemic times. PRM__state.name__PRM, like all states, is currently grappling with uncertainty regarding the summative spring assessments and accountability systems built from the results. Student academic growth is a significant component of PRM__state.name__PRM's accountability system and the lack of Spring 2020 results has necessitated an investigation into alternatives to the annual student academic growth calculations normally conducted.

This report summarizes findings of using skip-year growth as a substitute for the typical annual (i.e., one-year) student growth calculation. To pursue this investigation, historical TXT__test.name.abv__TXT data in PRM__GL_text__PRM was used to compare the SGPs derived from skip-year analyses (i.e., 2017 to 2019) versus sequential-year (non-skip, or one-year) analyses (i.e., 2018 to 2019). Comparisons between skip-year and sequential-year growth are examined at both the individual student level as well as the school level.

At the individual student level there is, not surprisingly, a very high correlation ($\sim TXT__exec.indiv.cor__TXT$) between skip-year SGPs and one-year SGPs (when the student has both). A very high correlation, however, does not preclude the existence of large differences for a substantial number of students. This is the case for more than 25 percent of students whose skip-year and one-year SGP differences exceed TXT__exec.indiv.qntl__TXT in magnitude.

At the school level there is, again not surprisingly, a very high correlation ($\sim TXT__exec.sch.cor__TXT$) between skip-year mean SGPs and one-year SGPs. However, the high correlation does mask approximately 10 percent of the schools whose mean SGP differs by TXT__exec.sch.qntl__TXT or more. The majority of schools demonstrating these large differences are elementary schools because TXT__excluded.grade.text__TXT SGPs can only be calculated using a sequential-year analysis given the available prior test scores. Thus, for those elementary schools, substantially different numbers of students are used to calculate the mean/median. As school performance ratings are comprised of other quantities besides student growth, the overall impact on school ratings may be muted.

As spring 2021 approaches and state summative assessments are scheduled to be given in PRM__state.name__PRM, the historical growth analyses discussed in this report support several recommendations:

- Historical analyses contained in this report do not unequivocally support or reject the use of skip-year student growth in lieu of one-year student growth for state accountability calculations at the school level. There is a high correlation between skip-year and sequential SGP results. However, there are a non-trivial number of cases where the differences are large enough to result in differing conclusions about student academic learning at a school.
- Historical analyses contained in this report are done under much better educational circumstances than currently exist. We think that the difficulty of current circumstances adds to skepticism for using skip-year student growth in lieu of one-year student growth. Based upon current evidence, the best stance is to assume that skip-year growth is *not* a valid substitute for one-year growth in 2021 *unless* 2021 skip-year growth analyses align well with historical skip-year analyses. Given current disruptions to student education due to COVID-19 in Fall 2021, it is unclear how well these analyses will align.
- Even with analyses that align well in 2021, it is not clear whether business-as-usual accountability is politically tenable. The issue of summative testing in 2021 is only partly technical in nature. There is a large pragmatic, non-technical, component to consider.
- Skip-year growth is extremely valuable to calculate even if not used for traditional accountability. Skip-year growth can be used to conduct investigations about the overall and differential impact of COVID-19 on the education of students. This has the potential to inform policy discussions about myriad of COVID-19 related issues including, for example, which modes of education best served students during the crisis.
