High correlations imply that the results demonstrate a strong linear relationship but do not imply that the results are identical or interchangeable. For students with both skip-year and one-year SGPs, 80 percent showed differences of less than `r indiv.q80` percentile points between calculation methodologies across grades and contents, while 20 percent of students showed differences of `r indiv.q80` or more. The results are not surprising as a substantial number of students show wide test score fluctuations over time. Dropping the most recent score from growth calculations when each year's scores differ greatly will lead to highly discrepant SGPs.

Lastly, we examined whether there are systematic differences in student achievement for students with one-year SGPs but no skip-year SGPs (i.e., those who do not have a prior from two-years earlier). Recall that students without a skip-year SGP are a small minority comprising approximately `r round(abs(mean(indiv_smry[eval(parse(text = params$skip.subset)), Difference_Pct])), 0)` percent of the population in each grade and content area. In general, students without skip-year SGPs were slightly `r ifelse((missing_smry$Mean_SS < 0), "lower", "higher")` achieving (z-score approximately `r round(missing_smry$Mean_SS, 2)` versus a z-score of 0.0 for all students) but displayed similar one-year growth (i.e., mean SGP = `r round(missing_smry$Mean_SGP, 2)`) in comparison to students with both one year and skip-year growth. It is unclear, based upon the data provided, whether there are systematic reasons for these students to not have a skip-year SGP (e.g., highly transient).

At the individual student level, reporting skip-year student growth in lieu of one-year student growth could misrepresent what skip-year growth actually quantifies (growth over two years instead of a single year). The investigation carried out with historical `r params$state.name` data suggests there is a close relationship between the two growth quantities, and 2021 skip-year growth could be used to draw inferences about what one-year growth would have been if students had tested in 2020. In addition to being the most relevant and accessible proxy for one-year growth available, skip-year growth can serve many valuable investigative purposes as well.
